# Lobby Synchronization Test Guide

## Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ Player list not updating in real-time when someone joins
2. ✅ Host transfer not showing in UI when original host disconnects
3. ✅ Player disconnection not showing in UI
4. ✅ **NEW FIX**: Player reconnection creating duplicate players instead of reconnecting existing ones
5. ✅ **NEW FEATURE**: localStorage for easy reconnection with auto-filled form fields
6. ✅ **NEW FEATURE**: Enhanced game board layout with realistic hand rotations

## Test Steps:

### Test 1: Real-time Player Join
1. Open browser tab 1 → Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Create room with nickname "Player1"
3. Copy room code
4. Open browser tab 2 → Go to `http://localhost:3000`
5. Join room with nickname "Player2"
6. **Expected**: Tab 1 should immediately show "Player2" in player list
7. **Expected**: Both tabs should show "2/5" player count

### Test 2: Host Transfer on Disconnect
1. Continue from Test 1 (2 players in room)
2. In tab 1 (original host), refresh the page
3. **Expected**: Tab 2 should show:
   - "Player1" stays in list but shows as disconnected (red pulsing dot, grayed out, "Disconnected (5min to reconnect)")
   - "Player2" gets HOST badge
   - "Start Game" button appears for Player2
   - Player count shows "1/2 (2/5)" indicating 1 connected out of 2 total players

### Test 3: Player Reconnection ✅ FIXED
1. Continue from Test 2
2. In tab 1, rejoin the same room with "Player1"
3. **Expected**: Tab 2 should show:
   - "Player1" changes from disconnected to connected (green dot, normal styling)
   - "Player2" keeps HOST badge
   - Player count shows "2/5" (both players now connected)
   - **NO duplicate "Player1" entries should appear**
4. **Expected**: Tab 1 should show "Reconnected to room" message in log

### Test 4: Multiple Players
1. Open tab 3, join as "Player3"
2. Open tab 4, join as "Player4"
3. **Expected**: All tabs should show all 4 players in real-time
4. Close tab 3 (Player3)
5. **Expected**: All remaining tabs should immediately show Player3 removed

### Test 5: localStorage Auto-Fill ✅ NEW
1. Create a room with nickname "TestPlayer" (or join an existing room)
2. Note the room code
3. Refresh the page or close/reopen the browser tab
4. **Expected**: 
   - "Join Room" form fields should be auto-filled with last used room code and nickname
   - "Create Room" nickname field should be auto-filled with last used nickname
   - Green notification should appear under Join Room form: "Auto-filled with last used data. Clear"
   - Log should show "Auto-filled room code" and "Auto-filled nickname" messages

### Test 6: Clear Saved Data ✅ NEW
1. Continue from Test 5 (with auto-filled form fields)
2. Click "Clear" link in the auto-fill notification
3. **Expected**:
   - Auto-fill notification should disappear
   - All form fields should be cleared
   - Log should show "Saved reconnection data cleared"
   - Success message should appear

### Test 7: Enhanced Game Board Layout ✅ NEW
1. Start a game with 2-5 players
2. **Expected Game Board Features**:
   - **Player Hand Rotations**: Hands should be rotated to simulate real table seating
     - 2 players: Bottom player (0°), top player (180°)
     - 3 players: Bottom (0°), left (90°), right (-90°)
     - 4 players: Bottom (0°), left (90°), top (180°), right (-90°)
     - 5 players: Evenly distributed around table (0°, 72°, 144°, -144°, -72°)
   - **Enhanced Fireworks Display**: Color-coded piles with progress indicators (X/5)
   - **Improved Token Display**: Visual counters for clue/fuse tokens with color coding
   - **Current Player Highlighting**: Own hand has blue border, current turn has green glow
   - **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to mobile screens while maintaining rotations

## Technical Implementation:

### New Socket Events:
- `getRoomState` - Client requests current room state
- `roomStateUpdated` - Server broadcasts updated player list
- Enhanced `hostChanged` - Now includes room state update

### Client-side Improvements:
- `requestRoomState()` function for requesting updates
- Real-time player list synchronization
- Session storage for page refresh handling
- Better error handling and button states
- Enhanced `roomJoined` handler to detect reconnections
- **NEW**: localStorage for persistent room code and nickname storage
- **NEW**: Auto-fill form fields on page load with subtle notification
- **NEW**: Clear saved data functionality
- **NEW**: Enhanced game board layout with CSS transforms for hand rotations
- **NEW**: Responsive design that maintains rotations on mobile

### Server-side Improvements:
- Broadcast room state on all player join/leave events
- Enhanced host transfer with immediate UI updates
- Proper disconnection handling with state sync
- **NEW**: Smart reconnection logic in `joinRoom` handler that checks for existing disconnected players with same nickname
- **NEW**: Proper reconnection flow that reuses existing player ID instead of creating duplicates

## Game Board Layout Features:

### Hand Rotation System:
- **2 Players**: Bottom (current player) + Top (180° rotation)
- **3 Players**: Bottom + Left (90°) + Right (-90°)
- **4 Players**: Bottom + Left (90°) + Top (180°) + Right (-90°)
- **5 Players**: Evenly distributed around circle (72° increments)

### Visual Enhancements:
- **Gradient backgrounds** for firework piles and cards
- **Hover effects** with smooth animations
- **Progress indicators** showing completion status
- **Color-coded tokens** with proper visual hierarchy
- **Z-index management** to prevent overlapping rotated hands

### Responsive Behavior:
- **Mobile optimization** with adjusted positioning
- **Maintained rotations** on smaller screens
- **Flexible sizing** for cards and containers
- **Touch-friendly** interface elements

## localStorage Features:

### Data Stored:
- `hanabiLastRoomCode` - Last successfully joined/created room code
- `hanabiLastNickname` - Last used nickname

### Auto-Fill Behavior:
- Room code auto-fills in "Join Room" field
- Nickname auto-fills in both "Create Room" and "Join Room" fields
- Data persists across browser sessions (unlike sessionStorage)
- Subtle notification appears when data is auto-filled
- Optional clear button to remove saved data

### Benefits:
- **Faster reconnection** after browser refresh or accidental closure
- **Clean, intuitive interface** - no extra UI sections needed
- **Persistent across sessions** unlike sessionStorage
- **Optional and clearable** - users can remove saved data if desired
- **Non-intrusive** - just auto-fills existing form fields

## Reconnection Fix Details:

### Problem:
When a player disconnected and tried to rejoin with the same nickname, the server would create a new player entry instead of reconnecting the existing disconnected player. This resulted in duplicate players in the room.

### Solution:
Modified the `joinRoom` handler to:
1. Check if there's an existing disconnected player with the same nickname
2. If found, reconnect that player (reuse same player ID, update socket connection)
3. If not found, create a new player as before
4. Properly notify all clients about the reconnection vs new join

### Benefits:
- Maintains consistent player identity across disconnections
- Preserves game state if reconnection happens during a game
- Prevents room from filling up with duplicate disconnected players
- Better user experience with clear reconnection messaging
- **NEW**: Combined with localStorage auto-fill, provides seamless reconnection experience
- **NEW**: Enhanced with realistic game board layout for immersive gameplay
