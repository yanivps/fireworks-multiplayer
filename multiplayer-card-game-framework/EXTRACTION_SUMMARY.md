# Framework Extraction Summary

## What We've Accomplished

We have successfully extracted the core multiplayer infrastructure from your Hanabi card game and created a reusable framework. Here's what we've built:

## 🔧 Components Extracted from Hanabi

### 1. **Room Management** (from `server.js`)
- ✅ Room creation with unique codes
- ✅ Player joining/leaving
- ✅ Host management and transfer
- ✅ Room cleanup and timeouts
- ✅ Player reconnection support

### 2. **Player Management** (from `server.js`)
- ✅ Player connection/disconnection handling
- ✅ Socket ID tracking
- ✅ Nickname validation
- ✅ Player state management

### 3. **Game Flow** (from `server.js`)
- ✅ Turn-based game orchestration
- ✅ Action validation and processing
- ✅ Game state synchronization
- ✅ End condition checking

### 4. **Network Layer** (from `server.js`)
- ✅ Socket.IO integration
- ✅ Event handling (create/join/leave/start/action)
- ✅ Real-time state broadcasting
- ✅ Error handling and validation

### 5. **Infrastructure** (from `server.js`)
- ✅ Express server setup
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Health monitoring endpoints
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling

## 🎮 What Stays Game-Specific

The following components remain in your Hanabi implementation and are NOT part of the framework:

- **Game Rules**: Card types, clue system, fireworks, scoring
- **Game State**: Hands, deck, tokens, turn logic
- **Game Actions**: Play, discard, clue validation and processing
- **UI Components**: Card rendering, game board, interactions
- **Game Assets**: Card images, sounds, styling

## 🚀 How to Use the Framework

### For New Games:

1. **Extend GameImplementation**:
```javascript
class MyCardGame extends GameImplementation {
  createInitialState(playerIds) { /* your game setup */ }
  validateAction(action, gameState, playerId) { /* your rules */ }
  processAction(action, gameState, playerId) { /* your logic */ }
  checkEndConditions(gameState) { /* your win conditions */ }
}
```

2. **Create Server**:
```javascript
const server = new GameServer(new MyCardGame(), { port: 3001 });
server.start();
```

3. **Connect from Client**:
```javascript
const socket = io();
socket.emit('createRoom', { nickname: 'Player1' });
socket.on('gameStateUpdate', (data) => { /* update UI */ });
```

## 🔄 Migrating Hanabi to Use Framework

To migrate your existing Hanabi game to use this framework:

1. **Create HanabiImplementation.js**:
   - Move game logic from `game/gameState.js`, `game/gameActions.js`, `game/gameEndConditions.js`
   - Implement the GameImplementation interface

2. **Replace server.js**:
   - Use `new GameServer(new HanabiImplementation())`
   - Remove all the room/player management code (now handled by framework)

3. **Update client code**:
   - Use standardized socket events
   - Handle `gameStateUpdate` events instead of custom events

## 📊 Framework Benefits

- **🔄 Reusability**: Core multiplayer logic works for any turn-based card game
- **🧪 Testability**: Framework components can be unit tested independently
- **🛠️ Maintainability**: Bug fixes in framework benefit all games
- **⚡ Rapid Development**: New games can focus on game logic, not infrastructure
- **📈 Scalability**: Built-in room management and cleanup
- **🔌 Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for game-specific features

## 🧪 Testing

The framework is working correctly:
- ✅ Server starts successfully on port 3001
- ✅ Health endpoint returns proper status: `{"status":"healthy","game":"Simple Card Game","version":"1.0.0","totalRooms":0,"totalPlayers":0,"activeGames":0,"waitingRooms":0}`
- ✅ Game info endpoint returns configuration: `{"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"name":"Simple Card Game","version":"1.0.0"}`

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Migrate Hanabi**: Create `HanabiImplementation.js` extending `GameImplementation`
2. **Client Framework**: Extract client-side components (lobby, networking, UI utilities)
3. **Add Features**: Database persistence, spectator mode, tournaments
4. **Publish**: Make it an npm package for broader use

## 💡 Example Usage

The framework is already working with a simple card game example. You can:

1. Run the example: `node examples/basic-server.js`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3001/health` to see server status
3. Connect with Socket.IO client to test room creation/joining
4. Implement your own card game by extending `GameImplementation`

This framework successfully abstracts all the multiplayer infrastructure while keeping game-specific logic separate and reusable!
